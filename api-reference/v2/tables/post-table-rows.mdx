Add row data to an existing Big Table.

## Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Add Rows Inline">
    If you want to add a small number of rows to a table, you can do so by providing the data inline (being sure that row object structure matches the table schema):

    ```json
    [
      {
        "fullName": "Alex Bard",
        "ageInYears": 30,
        "hiredOn": "2021-07-03"
      }, {
        "fullName": "Alicia Hines",
        "ageInYears": 34,
        "hiredOn": "2023-01-015"
      }
    ]
    ```

    However, this is only appropriate for relatively small dataset (a few hundred rows or less, depending on schema complexity). If you need to work with a larger dataset you should utilize stashing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Add Rows from Stash">
    [Stashing](/api-reference/v2/stashing/introduction) is our process for handling the upload of large datasets. Break down your dataset into smaller, more manageable, pieces and [upload them to a single stash ID](/api-reference/v2/stashing/post-stashes-serial). 

    Then, to add all the row data in a stash to the table in a single atomic operation, use the `$stashID` reference in the `rows` field instead of providing the data inline:

    ```json
    {
        "$stashID": "20240215-job32"
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
