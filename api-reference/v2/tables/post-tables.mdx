Create a new Glide Big Table, define its structure, and (optionally) populate it with data.

## Create Table w/ Row Data

If you want to create a table and populate it with an initial dataset, you can do so by providing the data inline in the `rows` field (being sure that row object structure matches the table schema):

```json
{
    "name": Employees",
    "schema": {
        "columns": [
            { "id": "fullName", "displayName": "Name", "type": "string" },
            { "id": "ageInYears", "displayName": "Age", "type": "number" },
            { "id": "hiredOn", "displayName": "Hired On", "type": "dateTime" }
        ]
    },
    "rows": [
        {
            "fullName": "Alex Bard",
            "ageInYears": 30,
            "hiredOn": "2021-07-03"
        }
    ]
}
```

However, this is only appropriate for relatively small initial datasets (around a few hundred rows or less, depending on schema complexity). If you need to work with a larger dataset you should utilize stashing.

## Create Table from Stash

[Stashing](/api-reference/v2/stashing/introduction) is our process for handling the upload of large datasets. Break down your dataset into smaller, more manageable, pieces and [upload them to a single stash ID](/api-reference/v2/stashing/post-stashes-serial). 

Then, to create a table from a stash, you can use the `$stashID` reference in the `rows` field instead of providing the data inline:

```json
{
    "name": "Employees",
    "schema": { ... },
    "rows": {
        "$stashID": "20240215-job32"
    }
}
```
