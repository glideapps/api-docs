title: Create Import Stash
openapi: post /api/stashes

When uploading a large dataset it is necessary to break it into smaller chunks for performance and reliability reasons. We call this process "stashing".

A "stash" is a temporary location where data can be uploaded in bulk (much like a bucket in cloud terminology). Once all the data has been added to the stash, across several API calls, all the data in the stash can then be used in a table as a single atomic operation.

This specific endpoint creates a new stash location and returns its ID. No data is uploaded in this call.
