When working with large datasets it is necessary to break it into smaller chunks for performance and reliability. We call this process "stashing".

<Tip>
  To understand what stashing is and how to use it to work with large datasets, please see our [introduction to stashing](/api-reference/v2/stashing/introduction).
</Tip>

<Warning>
  The stashID must be in the format of a UUID, e.g., `"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000"`. This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future release.
