If you no longer need a stash, you can delete it. This will remove the stash and all the data it contains. Stashes are automatically deleted within 48 hours of creation.

<Tip>
  To understand what stashing is and how to use it to work with large datasets, please see our [introduction to stashing](/api-reference/v2/stashing/introduction).
