If you no longer need a stash, you can delete it. This will remove the stash and all the data it contains.

<Note>Even if you do not call this endpoint, all stashes are automatically deleted within 48 hours after they are created.</Note>

<Tip>
  To understand what stashing is and how to use it to work with large datasets, please see our [introduction to stashing](/api-reference/v2/stashing/introduction).
