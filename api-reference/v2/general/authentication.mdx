## Format

The Glide API uses bearer token authentication in the request header in the form:

`Authorization: Bearer <token>`

`<token>` should be replaced with your actual token which you can find in the Glide Data Editor.

  You can find your API auth token in the Glide Data Editor

## Token Behavior

Please be aware of the following as it relates to your API auth token:

* It should be treated as a secret (i.e. it should not be checked into source control or exposed in client environments)
* It is unique to your Glide user
* It is scoped to your Glide team, so it has access to all applications and data in your team
