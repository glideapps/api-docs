## Payload Limits

You should not send more than 15MB of data in a single request. If you need to work with more data, use [stashing](/api-reference/v2/stashing/introduction) to upload the data in 15MB chunks.

## Row Limits

Even when using stashing, there are limits to the number of rows you can work with in a single request. These limits are approximate and depend on the size of the rows in your dataset.


| Endpoint                                                      | Row Limit  |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| [Create Table](/api-reference/v2/tables/post-tables)          | 8m         |
| [Overwrite Table](/api-reference/v2/tables/put-tables)        | 8m         |
| [Add Rows to Table](/api-reference/v2/tables/post-table-rows) | 250k       |

When adding rows to a table, the returned row IDs are guaranteed to be in the same order as the input rows provided in the request.
