title: Glide API v2
sidebarTitle: Introduction
---

The Glide APIv2 is a RESTful API that allows you to programatically interact with the Glide platform. These are the developer docs for version 2 of the API, initially released in July of 2024.

<Warning>This API is currently in a public alpha state. Feedback is welcome. However, please be aware that **breaking changes are expected**!</Warning>

## Functionality

This version of the Glide API **only accesses Glide Big Table data sources**. An attempt to use this API with any other data source will return an error.

## Location

The **temporary location** of the Glide API v2 is: `https://functions.staging.internal.glideapps.com/api/`.

## Previous Versions

This Glide API v2 differs from previous versions in that it:

- Is the most performant way to programatically interact with Glide Big Tables
- Is capable of ingesting much larger data sets through the use of [stashing](/api-reference/v2/stashing/introduction)
- Does not require application scoping (i.e., no `appId` is required)
- Only operates on Glide Big Tables data sources
