title: Glide API v2
sidebarTitle: Introduction
---

The Glide APIv2 is a RESTful API that allows you to programmatically interact with the Glide platform. These are the developer docs for version 2 of the API, initially released in July of 2024.

<Warning>This API is currently in a public beta state. Feedback is welcome. However, please be aware that **breaking changes are expected**!</Warning>

## Understanding Tables in Glide

Glide uses different types of tables to store and organize data within your applications. The main types of tables include:

### Big Tables
Big Tables are Glide's native database solution, designed for handling large datasets efficiently. They offer:
- High performance for large-scale data operations
- Direct API access through this v2 API
- Advanced querying capabilities
- Built-in data type validation
- Optimized for programmatic access

### Other Table Types
While not accessible through this API, Glide also supports:
- Google Sheets tables
- Excel tables
- Airtable connections
- CSV imports
- Custom data source integrations

<Note>
  This v2 API exclusively works with Big Tables, making it the ideal choice when you need to programmatically manage large datasets or require high-performance data operations.
</Note>

## Functionality

This version of the Glide API **only accesses Big Table data sources**. An attempt to use this API with any other data source will return an error.

## Location

The Glide API v2 is located at: `https://api.glideapps.com/`.

## Previous Versions

This Glide API v2 differs from previous versions in that it:

- Is the most performant way to programatically interact with Big Tables
- Is capable of ingesting much larger data sets through the use of [stashing](/api-reference/v2/stashing/introduction)
- Does not require application scoping (i.e., no `appId` is required)
- Only operates on Big Tables data sources
