title: Create Upload
openapi: post /apps/{appID}/uploads
---

Create an upload session and get a pre-signed upload URL. Upload the file bytes to the `uploadLocation`, then call the complete endpoint to finalize the file and receive a public URL.

## Example

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.glideapps.com/apps/$APP_ID/uploads \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $GLIDE_API_KEY" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "contentType": "image/png",
    "fileName": "logo.png"
  }'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "uploadID": "upload-123",
    "uploadLocation": "https://storage.googleapis.com/glide-uploads/example?X-Goog-Algorithm=GOOG4-RSA-SHA256"
  }
}
```

Then upload the file bytes to `uploadLocation`:

```bash
curl --request PUT \
  --url "$UPLOAD_LOCATION" \
  --header "Content-Type: image/png" \
  --upload-file ./logo.png
```

Finally, complete the upload:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.glideapps.com/apps/$APP_ID/uploads/$UPLOAD_ID/complete \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $GLIDE_API_KEY"
```

Note that Glide will delete this file within 30 days if the URL is not stored in a table in Glide.
