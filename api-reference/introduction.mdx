The Glide APIv2 is a RESTful API that allows you to programatically interact with the Glide platform. These are the developer docs for version 2 of the API, initially released in July of 2024.

<Warning>This version of the Glide API **only accesses Glide Big Table data sources**. An attempt to use this API with any other data source will return an error.</Warning>

## Previous versions

This Glide API differs from previous versions in that it:

- Is the most performant way to programatically interact with Glide
- Is capable of ingesting much larger data sets
- Includes advanced features to ensure data integrity and reliability (such as idempotency keys and date-based versioning)
- Only operates on Glide Big Tables data sources
- Does not require application scoping (i.e., no `appId` is required)
