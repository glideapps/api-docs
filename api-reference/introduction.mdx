The Glide API is a RESTful API that allows you to interact with the Glide platform programatically. These are the developer docs for version 2 of the API.

## Previous versions

<Warning>This version of the Glide API is **only available for Glide Big Tables**. An attempt to use this API with any other data source will return an error.</Warning>

This Glide API differs from previous versions in that:

- It only operates on Glide Big Tables data sources
- It does not require an `appId` with every call
- It is designed to be more performant
- It is capable of ingesting much larger data sets
