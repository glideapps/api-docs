# Glide API Documentation

These are the [customer facing API docs](https://glide.mintlify.app/) for the Glide API.

We are using [Mintlify](https://www.mintlify.com/docs/) to power this documentation, which is updated and maintained by editing the contents of this repository.

## Start

To run the documentation locally, run setup once:

```bash
script/setup
```

Then start the documentation server:

```bash
script/start
âœ” Local Mintlify instance is ready. Launching your site...
ðŸŒ¿ Your local preview is available at http://localhost:3000
ðŸŒ¿ Press Ctrl+C any time to stop the local preview.
```

## Development

To update or make changes to the documentation, you can edit the various Markdown files directly.

Much of the endpoint documentation is auto-generated by Mintlify by reading in the `swagger.json` file. Please note that this `swagger.json` file is heavily edited from the version served by Glide. So replacing the swagger file with one from Glide will most likely be destructive to the documentation.

If you need to update the swagger.json file, please consider saving a copy as swagger.staging.json (for example) and then manually importing the changes you need.

## Publishing

Once changes are made and confirmed in your local environment, you can commit your changes to Github. This will automatically trigger a build of the documentation and deploy to the live environment at: https://glide.mintlify.app/
