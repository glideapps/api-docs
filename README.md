# Glide API Documentation

These are the [customer facing API docs](https://glide.mintlify.app/) for the Glide API.

We are using [Mintlify](https://www.mintlify.com/docs/) to power this documentation, which is updated and maintained by editing the contents of this repository.

## Start

To run the documentation locally, run setup once:

```bash
$ script/setup
```

Then start the documentation server:

```bash
$ script/start
âœ” Local Mintlify instance is ready. Launching your site...
ðŸŒ¿ Your local preview is available at http://localhost:3000
ðŸŒ¿ Press Ctrl+C any time to stop the local preview.
```

## Development

To update or make changes to the documentation, you can edit the various Markdown files directly.

Much of the endpoint documentation is auto-generated by Mintlify by reading in the `swagger.json` file. Please note that this `swagger.json` file is heavily edited from the version served by Glide. So replacing the swagger file with one from Glide will most likely be destructive to the documentation.

If you need to update the swagger.json file, please consider saving a copy as swagger.staging.json (for example) and then manually importing the changes you need.

## Testing

Run the local `test` script to check for broken links in the documentation.

```bash
$ script/test
Checking for broken links...

api-reference/v2/stashing/introduction.mdx
  /api-reference/v2/tables/post-tables-rows
```

## Publishing

Once changes are made and confirmed in your local environment, you can commit your changes to Github. This will automatically trigger a build of the documentation and deploy to the live environment at: https://glide.mintlify.app/

## Postman

We use Postman to deliver executable endpoints of the Glide API to the public (in addition to what's available in the documentation). The Postman collection should be kept up to date with the latest endpoints and documentation. Unfortunately, this is a manual process for now.

Please update the Postman collection in the [Glide API v2 public collection](https://www.postman.com/glideapps-internal/workspace/glide/collection/32369785-2375efc0-3be9-43bd-a134-bd430deb4c69?action=share&creator=32369785&active-environment=32369785-f7167028-954c-4563-8b72-365cf2d69b3c) (distinct from the Glide internal Postman collection) with any changes to the API.
